# Node.js Inspect Debugger

> Reference for `systematic-debugging` skill. Load when debugging Node.js/TypeScript code during Phase 1 (Root Cause Investigation).

## Overview

When `console.log` isn't enough, drive Node's built-in V8 inspector programmatically from the terminal. You get real breakpoints, step in/over/out, call-stack walking, local/closure scope dumps, and arbitrary expression evaluation in the paused frame.

Two tools, pick one:

- **`node inspect`** — built-in, zero install, CLI REPL. Best for quick poking.
- **`ndb` / CDP via `chrome-remote-interface`** — scriptable from Node/Python; best when you want to automate many breakpoints, collect state across runs, or debug non-interactively from an agent loop.

**Prefer `node inspect` first.** It's always available and the REPL is fast.

## When to Use

- A Node test fails and you need to see intermediate state
- ui-tui crashes or behaves wrong and you want to inspect React/Ink state pre-render
- tui_gateway child processes (`_SlashWorker`, PTY bridge workers) misbehave
- You need to inspect a value in a closure that `console.log` can't reach without patching
- Perf: attach to a running process to capture a CPU profile or heap snapshot

**Don't use for:** things `console.log` solves in under a minute.

## Quick Reference: `node inspect` REPL

Launch paused on first line:

```bash
node inspect path/to/script.js
# or with tsx
node --inspect-brk $(which tsx) path/to/script.ts
```

The `debug>` prompt accepts:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `c` or `cont` | continue |
| `n` or `next` | step over |
| `s` or `step` | step into |
| `o` or `out` | step out |
| `pause` | pause running code |
| `sb('file.js', 42)` | set breakpoint at file.js line 42 |
| `sb(42)` | set breakpoint at line 42 of current file |
| `sb('functionName')` | break when function is called |
| `cb('file.js', 42)` | clear breakpoint |
| `breakpoints` | list all breakpoints |
| `bt` | backtrace (call stack) |
| `list(5)` | show 5 lines of source around current position |
| `watch('expr')` | evaluate expr on every pause |
| `watchers` | show watched expressions |
| `repl` | drop into REPL in current scope (Ctrl+C to exit REPL) |
| `exec expr` | evaluate expression once |
| `restart` | restart script |
| `kill` | kill the script |
| `.exit` | quit debugger |

**In the `repl` sub-mode:** type any JS expression, including access to locals/closure variables.

## Attaching to a Running Process

```bash
# 1. Send SIGUSR1 to enable the inspector on an existing process
kill -SIGUSR1 <pid>
# Node prints: Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/<uuid>

# 2. Attach the debugger CLI
node inspect -p <pid>
```

To start a process with the inspector from the beginning:

```bash
node --inspect script.js           # listen on 127.0.0.1:9229, keep running
node --inspect-brk script.js       # listen AND pause on first line
node --inspect=0.0.0.0:9230 script.js   # custom host:port
```

## Debugging Hermes ui-tui

### Debugging a running `hermes --tui`

```bash
# 1. Launch TUI
hermes --tui &
TUI_PID=$(pgrep -f 'ui-tui/dist/entry' | head -1)

# 2. Enable inspector on that Node PID
kill -SIGUSR1 "$TUI_PID"

# 3. Find the WS URL
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9229/json/list | jq -r '.[0].webSocketDebuggerUrl'

# 4. Attach
node inspect ws://127.0.0.1:9229/<uuid>
```

### Debugging `_SlashWorker` / PTY child processes

Those are Python, not Node — use the `python-debugging` reference instead. Only Node portions (Ink UI, tui_gateway client, tsx-run tests under `ui-tui/`) use this reference.

## Running Vitest Tests Under the Debugger

```bash
cd /home/bb/hermes-agent/ui-tui
# Run a single test file paused on entry
node --inspect-brk ./node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run --no-file-parallelism src/app/foo.test.tsx
```

Use `--no-file-parallelism` (vitest) or `--runInBand` (jest) so only one worker exists.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Wrong line numbers in TS source.** Breakpoints hit the emitted JS, not the `.ts`. Either break in the built `dist/*.js`, or enable sourcemaps.
2. **`--inspect` vs `--inspect-brk`.** `--inspect` starts the inspector but doesn't pause; your script races past your first breakpoint.
3. **Port collisions.** Default is `9229`. Use `--inspect=0` for random port.
4. **Child processes.** `--inspect` on a parent does NOT inspect its children.
5. **Background kills.** If you `Ctrl+C` out of `node inspect` while the target is paused, the target stays paused.
6. **Security.** `--inspect=0.0.0.0:9229` exposes arbitrary code execution. Always bind to `127.0.0.1`.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9229/json/list` returns exactly the target you expect
- [ ] First breakpoint actually hits
- [ ] Source listing at pause shows the right file
- [ ] `exec process.pid` in `repl` returns the PID you meant to attach to
